        =========================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        Solgema.PortletsManager improve general portlets managing.
        
        It adds the ability to order the portlets throughout the folder hierarchy
        by storing an ordered list of portlets in the portal root.
        
        It also adds the ability to very easily hide and show portlets separatly (not by type of portlet).
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        Maybe this should be "merged" in plone.app.portlets ???
